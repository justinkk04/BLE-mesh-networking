# 01 - Learning Path (Consolidated)

This page now acts as a route selector so content is not duplicated.

## Pick one path

1. Beginner route (recommended first): [[Beginner-Track]]
2. Practical study loop: [[How-To-Actually-Learn-This-Repo]]
3. Folder-first deep dive:
   - [[Architecture/Architecture-Index]]
   - [[Protocol/Protocol-Index]]
   - [[ESP-IDF/ESP-IDF-Index]]
   - [[Python-Gateway/Python-Gateway-Index]]
   - [[Hardware/Hardware-Index]]
   - [[Debugging/Debugging-Index]]

## Rule

When confused, return to one packet flow:

- [[Flows/End-to-End-READ-Flow]]
