# v0.7.1 Web UI Dashboard Plan

**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Author:** Justin Kwarteng
**Status:** Draft — Awaiting Review

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The current interface is a Python TUI (Textual) running in a terminal. While functional, it has significant limitations:

- **No remote access** — must SSH into the Pi 5 or run a terminal locally
- **No historical data** — sensor readings are ephemeral, gone once scrolled past
- **No visualization** — numbers in a table, no graphs or charts
- **No multi-user** — only one terminal session at a time

### Previous Attempt (v0.6.3 — failed)

A Flask-based dashboard was attempted with this architecture:

```
gateway.py ──(writes)──> mesh_state.json ──(reads)──> Flask ──(polls 2s)──> Browser
                                                        └──> SQLite (history)
gateway.py <──(reads)──  mesh_commands.json <──(writes)── Flask <── Browser
```

**Why it failed:**

- **JSON file IPC** — gateway writes JSON to disk on every sensor update; Flask reads it on every poll. SD card I/O becomes the bottleneck
- **2-second polling lag** — browser always 0-2s behind reality
- **Command race conditions** — `mesh_commands.json` read/write/delete between two processes is fragile
- **Monolithic dashboard.py** — 689-line file mixing routes, DB logic, mock data, command parsing
- **Flask is blocking** — single-threaded WSGI server cannot push data; browser must pull

## 2. Goal

**Replace the TUI with a real-time web dashboard** that:

1. **Pushes data instantly** via WebSockets (no polling, no JSON file IPC)
2. **Stores history** in SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent reads/writes
3. **Visualizes the mesh** with a D3.js topology graph and Chart.js time-series
4. **Sends commands** through WebSocket (no file-based command queue)
5. **Runs on any browser** — phone, laptop, tablet, anywhere on the WireGuard VPN
6. **Is modular** — each component in its own file, following v0.6.2 best practices

### Target Architecture

```
Browser(s)
  ↕  WebSocket (ws://pi5:8000/ws)
  ↕  REST API  (http://pi5:8000/api/*)
FastAPI Server (embedded in gateway process)
  ↕  In-process Python calls (no file IPC)
DCMonitorGateway + PowerManager
  ↕  BLE GATT
Universal Node(s)
```

**Key difference from v0.6.3:** No JSON files, no separate Flask process, no polling. The FastAPI server lives inside the same process as the gateway, so it has direct access to `DCMonitorGateway` and `PowerManager` objects. WebSockets push data the millisecond a BLE notification arrives.

### Development Environment

All development and testing is done on **Windows** with real ESP32-C6 nodes connected via BLE. The Python gateway (TUI + web server) runs natively on Windows using `bleak`. No mock mode is needed — real BLE data flows from the start. Final deployment to Pi 5 is for WireGuard remote access and production use.

## 3. Four-Phase Approach

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each phase is independently testable. Complete and verify each phase before starting the next.
> Phases are ordered by dependency — later phases build on earlier ones.

---

### Phase 1: Backend — FastAPI + WebSocket Server (Python only)

**Scope:** Add a FastAPI server with WebSocket support to the gateway process. No frontend yet — just the backend APIs.

**What changes:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/web_server.py` | **[NEW]** FastAPI app, WebSocket manager, REST endpoints |
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/db.py` | **[NEW]** SQLite database module (WAL mode, sensor history, settings) |
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/dc_gateway.py` | Add event hooks: `on_sensor_data`, `on_connect`, `on_disconnect` |
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/power_manager.py` | Add event hook: `on_pm_update` |
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/gateway.py` | Start FastAPI server alongside TUI (flag: `--web`) |
| `gateway-pi5/requirements.txt` | Add `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `websockets` |

**Risk:** 🟡 Medium — integrating async FastAPI with the existing BLE asyncio loop requires careful event loop management
**Effort:** ~300 lines of Python across 4 modules

**Key design decisions:**

- FastAPI runs on the **same asyncio event loop** as the BLE thread (uvicorn embedded)
- WebSocket manager holds a set of connected clients and broadcasts via `asyncio.Queue`
- `db.py` uses `sqlite3` with WAL mode for lock-free concurrent reads
- Gateway events are Python callbacks, not file writes

#### How to Test Phase 1

1. Start gateway with `python gateway.py --web`
2. Open `ws://localhost:8000/ws` in a WebSocket client (e.g., websocat, Postman)
3. Send a `read` command on the TUI — WebSocket should receive the sensor data JSON immediately
4. `GET http://localhost:8000/api/state` returns current mesh state
5. `GET http://localhost:8000/api/history?node_id=0&minutes=5` returns historical readings
6. `POST http://localhost:8000/api/command {"command": "0:READ"}` sends a command and returns the result

**Phase 1 is DONE when:** WebSocket pushes live sensor data, REST API returns state/history, and commands can be sent via HTTP POST — all with zero JSON file IPC.

---

### Phase 2: Frontend — Dashboard UI (HTML/CSS/JS only)

**Scope:** Build the web frontend. No backend changes — assumes Phase 1 APIs are stable.

**What changes:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/index.html` | **[NEW]** Main HTML shell with layout structure |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/css/style.css` | **[NEW]** Dark theme, glassmorphism, responsive grid |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/js/app.js` | **[NEW]** WebSocket connection, state management, event dispatch |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/js/topology.js` | **[NEW]** D3.js force-directed mesh graph |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/js/charts.js` | **[NEW]** Chart.js time-series (power, voltage, current) |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/js/nodes.js` | **[NEW]** Node card rendering, inline command menus |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/js/console.js` | **[NEW]** Live command console with log streaming |
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/web_server.py` | Add static file serving route for `/dashboard/*` |

**Risk:** 🟢 Low — pure frontend, no BLE or firmware changes
**Effort:** ~800 lines across HTML/CSS/JS

**Key design decisions:**

- **Vanilla JS** — no React/Vue/build step. Just ES modules loaded via `<script type="module">`
- **Single WebSocket connection** — `app.js` manages connect/reconnect and dispatches events to other modules
- **D3.js for topology** — fixed positions by role (Pi 5 at top, gateway below, nodes at bottom), smooth enter/update/exit
- **Chart.js for time-series** — rolling 30-minute window, one chart per node
- **CSS Grid layout** — header / topology+sidebar / node cards / console / footer

```

#### How to Test Phase 2

1. Start gateway on Windows: `python gateway.py --web` (BLE nodes connected)
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser
3. Verify: dark theme, topology graph shows Pi 5 + connected nodes
4. Send `read` in TUI → node cards update in real-time in the browser (no page refresh)
5. Click ⚙️ on a node card → set duty → confirm command executes
6. Type `read` in console → output appears immediately
7. History tab shows Chart.js graphs with rolling 30-minute power data

**Phase 2 is DONE when:** The browser shows a fully functional dashboard with real-time data, interactive node cards, topology graph, charts, and console — all driven by WebSocket.

---

### Phase 3: Polish — Auto-Polling, Multi-Metric Charts, Settings

**Scope:** Make the dashboard self-sufficient (no manual `read` commands needed), add voltage/current charts, expose PM settings via the web UI, and handle all edge cases.

**Already completed during Phase 2 (no additional work needed):**

- ✅ WebSocket auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (`app.js`)
- ✅ Stale/offline visual states — fade after 10s, red after 30s (`nodes.js`)
- ✅ Configurable time windows — 5m, 30m, 1h, 24h buttons (`charts.js`)
- ✅ Data retention — 7-day auto-purge (`db.py`)

**What still needs to change:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/dc_gateway.py` | **[NEW]** `start_web_poll(interval)` / `stop_web_poll()` coroutine — sends `ALL:READ` at configurable interval, suppresses TUI log spam via `_silent=True` |
| `gateway-pi5/gateway-code/web_server.py` | **[NEW]** Poll command handler (`poll 1.0`, `poll stop`) + Settings REST API (`/api/settings`) for threshold, budget, priority, poll interval |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/js/nodes.js` | **[MOD]** Add poll rate controls (start/stop button + interval input) to dashboard header or settings panel |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/js/charts.js` | **[MOD]** Add voltage and current datasets alongside power — switchable via tabs or stacked charts |
| `gateway-pi5/dashboard/css/style.css` | **[MOD]** Responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) |

**Risk:** 🟢 Low — incremental improvements on a working system
**Effort:** ~300 lines

**Key design decisions:**

- **PM-aware polling:** When PowerManager is active, it already polls all nodes via `poll_loop()`. The web auto-poll should auto-disable when PM starts and re-enable when PM stops — no double-polling.
- **Silent BLE reads:** Web-triggered `ALL:READ` commands use `_silent=True` so they don't flood the TUI log. Data still flows to WebSocket and DB.
- **Chart metrics:** Power is the primary chart; voltage and current are secondary tabs or a dropdown selector. All three are stored in the DB already.

#### How to Test Phase 3

1. Open dashboard → click "Start Polling" at 2s interval → nodes stay green without typing `read`
2. Enable PM → verify web poll auto-stops (PM takes over data flow)
3. Disable PM → verify web poll auto-restarts
4. Switch chart to "Voltage" tab → verify line chart shows V over time
5. Kill the gateway → browser shows "Disconnected" overlay → restart → auto-reconnects
6. Power-cycle a node → its card fades to "stale" → "offline" → glows green when it recovers
7. On Pi 5 deployment: open on phone (WireGuard) → verify responsive layout

**Phase 3 is DONE when:** Dashboard auto-polls without manual intervention, shows all three metrics (power/voltage/current), handles PM transitions gracefully, and has production-grade resilience.

---

### Phase 4: Integration Test & TUI Deprecation

**Scope:** End-to-end validation. Decide whether to keep TUI as fallback.

#### Integration Test Checklist

- [ ] 2+ universal nodes provisioned and running
- [ ] Browser shows topology with correct node count
- [ ] ALL:READ data appears on dashboard within 500ms
- [ ] Set duty from node card → node responds → dashboard updates
- [ ] Power-cycle connected node → failover → dashboard shows new connection
- [ ] PM threshold set from dashboard → balancing starts → charts show convergence
- [ ] Console sends commands and shows responses
- [ ] History charts show 30-minute rolling data
- [ ] Deploy to Pi 5 → open on phone via WireGuard → full functionality
- [ ] Gateway runs 24h without dashboard crashes or memory leaks

#### Cleanup

- [ ] Add `--web-only` flag to `gateway.py` (no TUI, web dashboard only)
- [ ] Update `README.md` with web dashboard setup
- [ ] Tag the repo as `v0.7.1`

**Phase 4 is DONE when:** All checklist items pass. The web dashboard is the primary interface.

## 4. Key Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Embedding FastAPI in the BLE Event Loop

The gateway already uses `asyncio` for BLE operations via `BleThread`. FastAPI/uvicorn also needs an event loop. Solution: run uvicorn programmatically on the same event loop using `uvicorn.Server` with `config.setup_event_loop = False`.

### Challenge 2: Thread-Safe WebSocket Broadcasting

BLE notifications arrive on the bleak callback thread. WebSocket sends must happen on the asyncio loop. Solution: use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to schedule broadcasts from the notification handler, similar to how the TUI uses `call_from_thread()`.

### Challenge 3: SQLite Concurrency

The gateway writes sensor data frequently; the web server reads it for history queries. Solution: WAL mode + separate read/write connections + `check_same_thread=False`.

### Challenge 4: Keeping the TUI Working

Some users may prefer the TUI. Solution: `--web` flag enables the web server alongside TUI. `--web-only` disables TUI entirely. Default behavior (no flags) is TUI-only for backward compatibility.

## 5. Lessons Learned from v0.6.3

| Problem | v0.6.3 Approach | v0.7.1 Fix |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Data staleness | JSON file + 2s browser polling | WebSocket push on every BLE notification |
| Command latency | Write JSON → gateway reads next poll | WebSocket → in-process function call |
| Dashboard crashes | Separate Flask process, file contention | Embedded in gateway process |
| Monolithic code | 689-line `dashboard.py` | Modular: `web_server.py`, `db.py`, separate JS modules |
| No history | Ephemeral JSON state only | SQLite with WAL mode, 7-day retention |
| Jittery graph | D3 force restart on every update | Only restart on topology changes, smooth data transitions |

---

## 6. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Justification |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Backend | FastAPI + Uvicorn | Async-native, WebSocket support, shares asyncio loop with BLE |
| Database | SQLite + WAL | Zero-config, embedded, fast enough for <10 nodes at 1 reading/sec |
| WebSocket | `websockets` library (via FastAPI) | Real-time push, no polling |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | No build step, no React/Vue complexity, runs anywhere |
| Topology | D3.js v7 (CDN) | Industry standard for network graphs |
| Charts | Chart.js v4 (CDN) | Lightweight time-series, no build step |
| Font | Inter (Google Fonts) | Clean, modern, great for dashboards |
